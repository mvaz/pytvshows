PyTVShows
=========

pytvshows downloads torrents for TV shows from RSS feeds provided by tvRSS.net. It is designed to be run from cron or a shell for programs like rTorrent. It is based on TVShows (http://tvshows.sourceforge.net/).

Installation
------------

To install:
$ python setup.py install

Usage
-----

To view available options:
$ pytvshows --help

Configuration
-------------

By default, the configuration is saved at ~/.pytvshows.cfg

This file is used to tell pytvshows what shows to download. It consists of 
headings of the exact tvrss.net names, and a series of parameters. The exact 
name is the name in the tvrss.net URL when viewing the episodes of a show.
For example:

[Heroes]
human_name = Heroes
episode = 23
season = 1
show_type = seasonepisode

[Without+a+Trace]

[Lost]
episode = 19
season = 3

PyTVShows writes data to this configuration file, so be sure it will not run 
you are editing. Ideally adding/removing shows would be done atomically by the 
program itself, but this is not a feature yet.

Heroes has already been processed by PyTVShows, that is why it has extra 
parameters. To stop downloading episodes for this show, simply remove it
from the configuration.

Without a Trace has been added by a user with no parameters, so the current 
season/episode will be determined and no episodes will be downloaded. New 
episodes will be downloaded thereafter.

Lost has been added by a user with an episode and season specified. Every 
episode after this will be downloaded (non-inclusive). If you want to download
an entire season, set the episode to 0.

A full list of parameters:
* show_type: Determines the type of show. seasonepisode, date or time.
* season: The season of the last episode downloaded (show_type: seasonepisode)
* episode: The last episode downloaded from season (show_type: seasonepisode)
* date: Date of last episode downloaded. (show_type: date)
* time: Time of last episode downloaded. (show_type: time)
* human_name: Name used for torrent file. Fetched automatically, should not
              need editing.

If uses a date instead of season/episode, the show_type date is used. If none
of these are specified, it falls back to time where the release time of the 
torrent is used. These are both experimental, I haven't had the time to test 
them properly. Feedback would be appreciated.

Here is a sample cron job that will run every half hour:

19,49 * * * * pytvshows

IMPORTANT: Please change the two numbers at the start to something different
that are half an hour apart. We don't want to be hammering tvrss.net's 
servers at a specific time.

Bugs
----

Please report bugs on sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pytvshows/

This should work on all platforms, but it has only been tested on Linux. At
some point I'll write up how to use it with rTorrent.
